Sometimes the best approach is to start fresh.

This bathroom had seen better days—failing tile, water damage behind the walls, and a layout that never quite worked. We took it down to the studs, addressed the moisture issues properly, and rebuilt with materials that will last.

Large-format porcelain tile. Clean lines. A walk-in shower with a linear drain. Nothing flashy, just solid work done right.
