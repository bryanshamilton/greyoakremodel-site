A comprehensive renovation that transformed a closed-off floor plan into an open, functional home.

The scope included removing a load-bearing wall between the kitchen and living area, a complete kitchen remodel with custom cabinetry, two bathroom renovations, and new flooring throughout the main level.

We coordinated all trades from start to finish—structural work, electrical, plumbing, tile, carpentry. The result is a cohesive space that feels intentional, not pieced together.
