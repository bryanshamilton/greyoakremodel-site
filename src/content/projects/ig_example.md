This is an example project file demonstrating the format expected from the Make.com Instagram sync automation.

The caption from Instagram goes here, with hashtags optionally stripped or preserved. Line breaks from the original caption should be converted to proper markdown paragraphs.

This project shows a mix of images and video (Reel) content in a single carousel post.
