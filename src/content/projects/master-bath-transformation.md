A complete master bathroom renovation focused on timeless materials and thoughtful details.

The original space was dated and poorly laid out. We opened it up, reconfigured the shower to take advantage of natural light, and installed floor-to-ceiling tile with warm metallic finishes throughout.

Custom glass enclosure. Heated floors. Proper waterproofing behind every surface. The kind of work that holds up.
