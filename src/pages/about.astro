            We started Grey Oak because we got tired of watching remodeling done poorly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corners cut to save an hour. Materials swapped without telling the homeowner.
            Tile work that looks fine until you notice every line is slightly off.
            Contractors who disappear mid-project or finish with a shrug and a "good enough."
          </p>
          <p>
            That's not how we work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe a remodel should be built to last—not just look good on day one,
            but hold up for years. That means proper waterproofing behind every shower.
            Level tile with consistent grout lines. Trim that's coped, not caulked.
            The details that most people won't notice, but that make the difference
            between work that endures and work that doesn't.

          <h3>The details are the work.</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone can install tile. Installing it level, plumb, with clean lines and
            proper substrate prep—that's the job. We don't skip steps.

          <h3>Your home deserves respect.</h3>
          <p>
            We're guests in your space. That means clean jobsites, clear communication,
            and treating your home like we'd want ours treated.

          <h3>Honesty over salesmanship.</h3>
          <p>
            We'll tell you what a project actually costs, how long it will actually take,
            and whether we're actually the right fit. No games.

          <h2>What We're Not</h2>
          <p>
            We're not a handyman service. We're not the cheapest option. We don't do
            "quick and dirty" or "good enough for now."
          </p>
          <p>
            If that's what you need, no hard feelings—but we're not your contractor.

            If you want work done right, by people who care about the craft, we should talk.
