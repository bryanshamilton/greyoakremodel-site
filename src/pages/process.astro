            <h3>Consultation</h3>
            <p>
              Every project starts with a conversation. We'll discuss what you're hoping
              to accomplish, walk through your space, and talk through scope, timeline,
              and budget expectations. This is also where we determine fit—for both of us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consultations are free and come with no obligation. If we're not the right
              contractor for your project, we'll tell you.
            </p>
            <div class="step-details">
              <h4>What to expect</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>30–60 minutes, in person at your home</li>
                <li>Honest assessment of scope and feasibility</li>
                <li>Preliminary budget discussion</li>
                <li>Clear next steps if we move forward</li>

            <h3>Plan & Selections</h3>
            <p>
              Once we agree on scope, we move into detailed planning. This includes
              finalizing the design, selecting materials, and building out a comprehensive
              project proposal. You'll see exactly what's included, what it costs, and
              how long it will take.
            </p>
            <p>
              We guide material selections based on your budget, aesthetic preferences,
              and durability requirements. No pressure to upgrade. No bait-and-switch.
            </p>
            <div class="step-details">
              <h4>What to expect</h4>

                <li>Detailed written proposal with line-item costs</li>
                <li>Material recommendations and sourcing</li>
                <li>Realistic timeline with key milestones</li>
                <li>Contract review before any work begins</li>

            <h3>Build</h3>
            <p>
              This is where the work happens. We maintain clean, organized jobsites.
              We communicate progress and don't disappear for days without updates.
              If something unexpected comes up—and in remodeling, it sometimes does—we
              discuss it with you before making decisions.

            <h3>Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>
              Before we call a project complete, we walk through it together. We review
              every detail, note anything that needs attention, and make sure you're
              satisfied with the work. Small punch-list items get handled promptly.
              We don't consider a job done until you do.

                <li>Punch list created and completed</li>
                <li>Final cleaning before handoff</li>
                <li>Documentation of any warranties or care instructions</li>

            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>
              Our relationship doesn't end at the final walkthrough. If something comes
              up after we've finished—a question about care, a minor adjustment, or an
              issue that needs attention—reach out. We stand behind our work.
